## 1. Neumorphism
A skeuomorphism is an imitation of an object intended to represent the original. Similar to skeuomorphism, neomorphism (or neo-skeuomorphism) visual style uses design elements and textures that mimic the physical world. It uses a lot of purely decorative forms to remind users about the physical origins of interactive elements (i.e. digital buttons that look like physical buttons, etc.)

### Problem: overuse of purely decorative elements
Neomorphism has one key difference from skeuomorphism: designers who apply neomorphism mimic the physical world for purely aesthetic purposes. This visual style does not have much impact on the usability of a product because users are already familiar with what each element on the screen does. In fact, it can have a negative effect on accessibility because it can be hard to find a proper contrast ratio for textual content and iconography.
Similar to skeuomorphism, neomorphism makes it challenging to adapt the design to different screen sizes (UI elements aren’t naturally scalable). Thus, if you want to follow this visual style, you need to consider whether or not you want to scale your design across multiple platforms.

### Solution
While it’s better not to rely on neomorphism to create entire UI, yet it is still possible to use in some parts of your product. For example, create some buttons in a neomorphic way.

## 2. Flat illustrations
When flat illustration became popular a few years ago, it was a fresh way to create visual interest. Unique custom-made illustrations help brands to distinguish themselves from the crowd, and well-crafted illustrations created a very personal connection with users.

### Problem: lack of personal style
Lack of personality is the typical problem of flat illustrations. With the rise of popularity of this technique, it became evident that too many digital products rely on the same illustration techniques in their design — illustration shows people doing something, usually working with a product.
As a result, illustration from different brands look similar, and it became hard for users to match the particular illustration to a particular brand.
